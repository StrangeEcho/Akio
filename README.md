# AKIO REWRITE

<img src="https://bit.ly/3owiERb" width="380px">

Update: The Re-write is almost done. I've successfully removed useless commands and rewrote the ones that had shit code(all of them)

---
Todo:
- stats command & jays customs tommorow?
- I dont fucking know anymore. Its 2:14 am and im tired as shit

---
Setup Instructions(Mainly for Jay):
- Open a terminal(most preferably powershell)
- `cd` into whatever directory you want the bot in(i.e: `cd desktop/somebotfolder`)
- Enter these bash commands into your terminal(WHILE STILL IN BOT DIRECTORY)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yat-o/Akio
touch config.py
pip3 install -r requirements.txt -U 
```
- With that last command you now need to edit the config file. For this open the config.py file you just made in notepad and paste the pre-set config. I will dm you all of that and whatnot
### It should look like this(copy and paste if needed)

```
token = "token here"
client_id = 123
prefix = ">:"
```
Now after pasting the stuff into that file. Hit `ctrl+s` 

Finally after that do `python3 main.py` to run the bot. If something doesnt work out right. DM me.

### Have Fun
