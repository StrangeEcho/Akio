# Akio

The Code Base For This Bot Is Literally Garbage.\
Nevertheless, if you want to contibute to the bot or try self hosting(not recommended) These are the steps:

- Make sure python3.6+ is installed. 3.7 is heavily recommende
- `cd` into some directory where you wanna put the bot files
- open a terminal and do these commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yat-o/Akio
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
python3 akio.py
```

Notes:
